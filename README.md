## 🛠 Methodology & Tools
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Modeling Techniques:**
    * Time Series Decomposition (Trend, Seasonality, Noise).
    * Stationarity Testing (ADF Test).
    * Forecasting Models (e.g., ARIMA/SARIMA, Holt-Winters, or Regression - *based on your code*).
    * Model Evaluation (MAPE, RMSE).

## 📊 Key Findings
*(You can briefly summarize 1-2 main points from your slides here. Example below:)*
* Identified a strong seasonal pattern in loan disbursement towards the end of the fiscal year.
* The forecasting model achieved an accuracy rate of **X%** (or low MAPE), proving reliable for short-term liquidity planning.
